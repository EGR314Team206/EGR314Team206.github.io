## Design Ideation
To maximize the possible design concepts for the mobile weather station, over one hundred different ideas were brainstormed that covered possible movement, material, and electrical components. The team first began by thinking of different ways in which the sensors could be used, and created ideas off that. Then the team dived into research of what needs user’s have with similar devices.

### 100+ Generated Ideas

After organizing the ideas, the team started by eliminating movement possibilities that didn’t seem to be the most suitable for the remote weather station. Items that didn’t meet our stakeholders needs were excluded with a primary focus on a lack of accuracy required for functioning. Once there were three categories of specific ideas, the team began to eliminate any potential ideas that wouldn’t coincide with the chosen idea. After compiling all of the ideas, the specified general idea groups would become the three design concepts outlined below.
The rankings as seen in the stars of each major category of needs was chosen based on the device and how important it was to the user for the product to have such requirements.

### Three Chosen Ideas

### Design Concepts
The team worked together to come up with the overall design of the three concepts, and with the help of Gavin, Abigail, and Jacob, they sketched each concept.

#### Concept 1

#### Satisfying User Needs with Design Concepts
Each of these design concepts satisfy requirements in the following ways. The first design uses a temperature sensor to control the atmosphere for an animal so it would be similar to a habitat type environment. The sensors would use I2C and the motor to open and close the door would be SPI. For the second design, there would be a wind and pressure sensor which is part of the project requirements. The third design is a sailboat that senses wind speed and humidity using sensors. These sensors would require I2C and a motor would move the sail using SPI interface. The design satisfies user needs since the moisture sensor helps the boat only to activate when in water. This saves on battery life and makes it more convenient and user friendly for the user. The motor controls movement via sail, instead of a rudder and propeller. This makes it safer for the user. Lastly the placement of the wind sensor on the top of the mast allows for better readings and thus more accuracy that the user required for the design.
