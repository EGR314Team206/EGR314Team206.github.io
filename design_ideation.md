## Design Ideation
To maximize the possible design concepts for the mobile weather station, over one hundred different ideas were brainstormed that covered possible movement, material, and electrical components. The team first began by thinking of different ways in which the sensors could be used, and created ideas off that. Then the team dived into research of what needs user’s have with similar devices.

### 100+ Generated Ideas

After organizing the ideas, the team started by eliminating movement possibilities that didn’t seem to be the most suitable for the remote weather station. Items that didn’t meet our stakeholders needs were excluded with a primary focus on a lack of accuracy required for functioning. Once there were three categories of specific ideas, the team began to eliminate any potential ideas that wouldn’t coincide with the chosen idea. After compiling all of the ideas, the specified general idea groups would become the three design concepts outlined below.
The rankings as seen in the stars of each major category of needs was chosen based on the device and how important it was to the user for the product to have such requirements.

### Three Chosen Ideas

### Design Concepts
The team worked together to come up with the overall design of the three concepts, and with the help of Gavin, Abigail, and Jacob, they sketched each concept.

#### Concept 1
