## Selected Design: Overview
The chosen design is a sailboat that senses wind speed and humidity using sensors. These sensors would require I2C and a motor would move the sail using SPI interface. The design satisfies user needs since the moisture sensor helps the boat only to activate when in water. This saves on battery life and makes it more convenient and user friendly for the user. The motor controls movement via sail, instead of a rudder and propeller. This makes it safer for the user. Lastly the placement of the wind sensor on the top of the mast allows for better readings and thus more accuracy that the user required for the design. This design was chosen out of the others because the team beleived its construction would be easily attainable and no other team had any sort of boat-related design. This was the best option for the team because all memebers felt comfortable with constructing a boat.
