## Team Establishment
### Charter
Based on the goals listed in [Appendix A](appendix_a.md) and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter:

_Our team will work together respectively and considerately, valuing each other’s input and keeping deadlines and assignment requirements in mind._

### Mission Statement
Based on the project description and project requirements, the team has come up with the following mission statement:

_To be successful in our understanding of embedded design concepts in relation to environmental sensing and their application to the final product, our team will focus on expanding our knowledge of MPLAB X IDE to broaden our interests and discover new areas of curiosity, while ultimately working towards the creation of an interesting, engaging, and educational final product._

In order to accomplish this, the team needs an understanding of environmental sensing and how these concepts can be used to help detect changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind. As well as sharpening our skills in MPLAB X IDE to better understand a different interface and controller. 

For more information on the team’s establishment please see section [Appendix A](appendix_a.md).
