### Communication Procedures
_Team Communication:_

All team members will conduct communication to one another through group text, in class collaboration and possibly through Zoom as seen in Table 1. Our main choice for communication is either text or verbally.

_Instructor Correspondence:_

Claire Rogers will be responsible for instructor correspondence and will communicate all information to the team via text.

### Meeting Schedule
_Team Prefered Meeting Time:_

As shown above, every point that is highlighted in green represents times that all team members will be available to discuss/work on assignments.. For our team, each of us are available on Friday from noon to 2pm. Therefore we will meet on Friday at noon each week as seen in the above **Table 2**.

### Meeting Coordination
_Team Meeting Reminder:_

In order to remind our team about meeting, we will text in our shared group chat a few hours before the meeting begins. If someone is late, we will remind them through text or a call to ensure everyone shows up.

_Team Meeting Changes:_

If there needs to be a change to a meeting, the team member must notify the group and suggest a time they can meet instead. If that time works for everybody, then the meeting will be changed to accommodate.

_Team Preferred Meeting Format:_

Meeting face to face will be the most effective method of communication for our team, however virtual meeting is currently also acceptable. In the future, it will become necessary to have in-person meetings as the course becomes almost exclusively hands-on as it progresses.

_Team Procedures:_

Talk about assignments as a group in class, splitting the work as necessary and then reconvening when the assignment is 90% completed to discuss any questions and make sure everyone is on the same page before submitting.

### Team Coordination
_Team Assignment Submission:_

One member of the team will be in charge of submitting the assignment and must verify with all team members before submitting. 

_Team Knowledge/Skills:_

Each team member will be responsible for a certain part of each assignment. If he or she is unable to complete their part, they must ask for assistance from another member of the team before the due date. This will help catch all members up to speed with the development of the project.

_Team Prefered Design Feedback:_

Each member will check the other team members’ work and cross check it with the feedback given to ensure that it has been acted upon. This will ensure that none of the work produced is conflicting with each other.

### Team Accountability
_Accountability Charter:_

Each team member will be responsible for an equal amount of the work in order to maintain equal responsibility amongst one another. Regular team check-ins will make sure that contributions will not be missed.
 
_Accountability Expectations:_

Each team member will be expected to complete their work in order to be a successful team. We all want to create the best design in the class and that will only be accomplished through unified group work.

_Recognizing Underperforming Team members:_

If they are asking a lot of questions or need a more than usual amount of help to perform a specific task.

_Supporting Team Members:_

We can help each other improve partly during class if it is a brief problem or during our weekly meetings.

### Conflict and Resolution
Controversy can be normal, but we all want to learn and should always be kind and respectful to one another. I don’t believe that this will be an issue in our group, but if it does become a problem, we will host a team meeting to discuss with all the team members to come up with a compromise or resolution for the conflict.
