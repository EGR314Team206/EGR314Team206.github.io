Figure #: Block Diagram

We choose the Microchip PIC18F27Q10 since it meets course requirements and have the I2C and SPI support we need as well as just enough additional pins for pushbuttons, LEDs, and the programmer. Jacob and Claire's sensor each feature a unique Analog-to-Digital converter that supports I2C. Abby's SPI motor driver controls her stepper motor. And Gavin's PIC18F27Q10 controls the whole thing!
