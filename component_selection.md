**Component #1:** Bidirectional Motor (1568-1660-ND).

The team had access to this motor, meaning the team already had the component as well as the data sheet and knowledge of the device. Despite this component being listed as 12V, we know it will operate at the 9V needed for the system. This solution will work for the board and also do not need to dedicate a portion of the budget to this component.

**Component #2:** Motor Driver (IFX9201SGAUMA1).

This motor driver was provided in class so the team was already familiar with its properties. It was able to operate from 3.3v to 40V which means it can operate at either 9V or 3.3V.

**Component #3:** Texas Instruments Voltage Regulator (LM2575S-3.3G).

This component was also provided in class which means the team has had previous experience with it. Two of these voltage regulators will be used because there is a 3.3V power rail, as well as a 9V power rail. Since this component is able to regulate anywhere between 7V and 40V, it can regulate any voltage from 7V to 40V down to 3.3V making it the ideal component for our system.

**Component #4:** Hall Effect Sensor (AS5600-ASOM).

This component was changed from the anemometer rather close to the due date of the project. The team had easy access to this hall effect sensor and it would be much easier to get it working properly than the initial alternative component.

**Component #5:** Microchip Technology Analog to Digital Converter (MCP3426A0T-E/SN).

The anaolog to digital converter also operates between 2.7V and 5.5V which works with the 3.3V power rail, and also fulfills the I2C component of the project requirements.
