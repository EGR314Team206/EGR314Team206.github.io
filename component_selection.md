**Component #1:** Stepper Motor Hybrid Bipolar (1528-1062-ND).

The target voltage for the system's motor is 3.3V or 9V. The selected motor is able to operate at 3.3V, which meets the needs of the project. It is also a bipolar motor that is not too expensive which makes it a good choice for this component.

**Component #2:** Motor Driver (IFX9201SGAUMA1).

This motor driver was provided in class so the team is already familiar with its propoerties. It is able to operate from -.3v to 40V which means it can operate at either 9V or 3.3V,

**Component #3:** Texas Instruments Voltage Regulator (LM2575S-3.3G).

This component was also provided in class which means the team has had previous experience with it. Two of these voltage regulators will be used because there is a 3.3V power rail, as well as a 9V power rail. Since this component is able to regulate anywhere between 7V and 40V, it can regulate any voltage from 7V to 40V down to 3.3V making it the idea component for our system.

**Component #4:** Adafruit Anemometer (1733).

This anemometer is relatively inexpensive and operates within the given voltage requirememts which fits the needs of the project.

**Component #5:** Microchip Technology Analog to Digital Converter (MCP3426A0T-E/SN).

The second anaolog to digital converter also operates between 2.7V and 5.5V which works with the 3.3V power rail, and also fulfills the I2C component of the project requirements.
