# Introduction

Mobile weather stations are important for giving accurate weather
information to local populations. These stations can also be used to
monitor weather conditions during response operations. As well as
personal or specific business needs where control, monitoring, and
adaptation under select conditions are required. People need the ability
to sense and respond to environmental conditions such as temperature,
humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and other modalities using
I2C or SPI for a mobile weather station that connects over Wi-Fi.
Throughout this report, the team will discuss different topics related
to the completion of a successful prototype.

# **Team Establishment**

**Charter**

Based on the goals listed in **Appendix A** and through a team
discussion, we constructed the following charter:

*Our team will work together respectively and considerately, valuing
each other's input and keeping deadlines and assignment requirements in
mind.*

**Mission Statement**

Based on the project description and project requirements, the team has
come up with the following mission statement:

*To be successful in our understanding of embedded design concepts in
relation to environmental sensing and their application to the final
product, our team will focus on expanding our knowledge of MPLAB X IDE
to broaden our interests and discover new areas of curiosity, while
ultimately working towards the creation of an interesting, engaging, and
educational final product.*

In order to accomplish this, the team needs an understanding of
environmental sensing and how these concepts can be used to help detect
changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind. As well as
sharpening our skills in MPLAB X IDE to better understand a different
interface and controller.

For more information on the team's establishment please see section
[**[Appendix A]{.underline}**](#appendix-a-team-organization).

# **VOC Benchmarking:**

## VOC Introduction:

To determine common user needs for devices using sensors for various
weather conditions, material of the product, objects with motor control,
etc. The team started with searching for different products that were
similar to the requirements given for the project. Keywords used
commonly pertained to weather as well as connectivity to find alike
products. From there a specific product would be chosen (normally one
with many reviews), and three positive and three negative reviews were
taken from it to spot the needs associated with it. Five products were
chosen in total for this, and from that, 100 user needs were observed.
Listed below are the five products, keywords used to find them, the link
for the search results and the product, price, vendor, description,
reviews, and a picture of the product chosen.

| "1. Functional Design. The        | 1.  Functional design (explicit)  |
| Ambient Weather station (AW) is   |                                   |
| the clear winner and way, way     | 2.  Accurate readings (explicit)  |
| ahead of Acurite (AR). For        |                                   |

| utilizes wireless. That is a      |                                   |
| horribly outdated and expensive   | 4.  Durable (explicit)            |
| design. Setup with the AW station |                                   |
| was a breeze\...I was assembled,  |                                   |
| mounted, and up and running on    |                                   |
| Wunderground within 20 minutes,   |                                   |
| and most of that was with the     |                                   |
| physical assembly.                |                                   |

| 2\. Accuracy. Once again, AW is   |                                   |
| the clear winner. All the         |                                   |
| readings on the AW were spot on   |                                   |
| right out of the box. Temp,       |                                   |
| rainfall, etc were good with no   |                                   |
| calibration necessary - though    |                                   |
| all readings can be calibrated if |                                   |
| needed, that functional           |                                   |

| 3\. Durability. This is the one   |                                   |
| area I cannot yet commend the AW  |                                   |
| on, only time will tell. It       |                                   |

## Assessment of User Needs

The process of forming the user needs statements started with the
benchmarking assignment which helped the team understand what consumers
expected out of their product and what they thought the product needed
improvement on. The team took the positive and negative comments and
turned them into user needs. Once the user needs were made, they were
separated into groups based on the description. The groups became
accuracy, durability, usability/user interaction, and
convenience/safety. Safety included all those that revolved around how
the product would mitigate harm to the user. Accuracy referred to how
the user would interact with the product. Quality dealt with using
durable materials to prevent the need to replace parts. The instructions
category was for documentation on the item to avoid facilitator or user
error. These 5 categories seemed to encapsulate most aspects of the user
needs based on the benchmarking process.

## Weighting of User Needs

After that was the ranking process, this was a discussion on what was
deemed the most important and least important to the project design.
Durability, and user engagement deserved three stars, accuracy deserved
two stars, and convenience/safely deserved one star. Durability and user
engagement/experience were three stars because those were highlighted
the most in the benchmarking. The accuracy deserved two stars is not as
essential as the above groups. The convenience/safety were 1 star
because it is not as important as the other categories since it is not a
hazardous product and most customers purchasing this product expect some
setup. Overall, the user needs process was very useful in helping the
understanding of what the customers wanted.

# **Product Requirements**

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to plan, design, and develop a mobile
weather sensing station with a motorized control response to show off to
companies, professionals, and peers. As well as create a GitHub website
for personal portfolios to demonstrate application of embedded systems
to future prospects.

## Stakeholders

### Users:

**Rural Dwellers** - Those in remote locations may not have accurate
weather forecasts or data. With this mobile weather station device, they
can respond accordingly to accurate data. Or have an automatic system to
do so.

**Miners** - Those in harsh working industrial environments need to keep
workers safe from high pollution, heatstroke, and humidity.

## Use Cases

*Use Case 1*: 34-year-old Steven works as an engineer at WeatherFlow.
This year he decided to attend the Innovation Showcase at ASU to review
some of the products some of the students have made. He heard that the
main focus of the devices was sensing various changes of weather, such
as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Steven is looking for products
that can use these variables, and display them on his phone. He is
looking to hire some bright, inventive designers that could help improve
the products they make.

*Use Case 2:* 56-year-old John is a farmer who is used to using various
sensors to detect changes in weather. However, he\'s never known how
these sensors work. He's heard a couple things such as the differences
between serial and analog sensors, but he's never actually known what
they meant. He heard that ASUs Innovation Showcase has products that fit
this exact description. So, he decided to attend it this year to get a
little more insight as to how the equipment he commonly uses works.

## Converting User Needs into Specifications

## Open Questions

-   How can we design a product that is engaging and attracts attendants
    > at the innovation showcase?

-   How would the wifi element be incorporated into our weather sensing
    > design?

-   How can we use temperature/humidity sensing technology to solve a
    > problem in our community?

-   Can we prioritize safety while still creating a product design that
    > fits all other user needs?

-   Will there be room to expand upon our design once it is finished?

-   What elements can we include that would set our product apart from
    > anything like it already on the market?

-   In what ways can we incorporate a motor into a temperature/humidity
    > sensor design?

-   How will the device utilize all project requirements while still
    > being unique from other class designs?

## Assessing Designs

To ensure designs meet the criteria above, they must be assessed. The
manner in which they will be assessed is each design aspect category
being weighted as follows: 30%: Durability/hardware, 30%: Usability/user
interaction, 25%: Accuracy, and 15%: convenience/safety. Then, each
sub-aspect will be assessed by each team member on completion on a scale
of 1-3, where 1 is failure, 2 is partial success, and 3 is success. Upon
averaging each team member\'s decisions the design assessment will be
finished. At this point, design changes and adaptations will be
discussed to increase the score of a design if the team chooses. This
will ensure the final product meets requirements.

# **Design Ideation**

To maximize the possible design concepts for the mobile weather station,
over one hundred different ideas were brainstormed that covered possible
movement, material, and electrical components. The team first began by
thinking of different ways in which the sensors could be used, and
created ideas off that. Then the team dived into research of what needs
user's have with similar devices.

### Sorted Ideas Legend

Yellow- Sensing

Green- User-friendly

Blue- Software

Pink- Design

Orange- Safety

## 100+ Generated Ideas

![](media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="3.6666666666666665in"}

**Figure 5.** Image of one hundred generated design concept ideas

After organizing the ideas, the team started by eliminating movement
possibilities that didn't seem to be the most suitable for the remote
weather station. Items that didn't meet our stakeholders needs were
excluded with a primary focus on a lack of accuracy required for
functioning. Once there were three categories of specific ideas, the
team began to eliminate any potential ideas that wouldn't coincide with
the chosen idea. After compiling all of the ideas, the specified general
idea groups would become the three design concepts outlined below.

The rankings as seen in the stars of each major category of needs was
chosen based on the device and how important it was to the user for the
product to have such requirements.

## Three Chosen Ideas

##

**Communication Procedures**

*Team Communication:*

All team members will conduct communication to one another through group
text, in class collaboration and possibly through Zoom as seen in
**Table 1**. Our main choice for communication is either text or
verbally.

*Instructor Correspondence:*

Claire Rogers will be responsible for instructor correspondence and will
communicate all information to the team via text.

**Meeting Schedule**

***Table 2**: Team Member Availability Schedule*

![](media/image18.png){width="4.458333333333333in"
height="2.87839457567804in"}

*Team Prefered Meeting Time:*

As shown above, every point that is highlighted in green represents
times that all team members will be available to discuss/work on
assignments.. For our team, each of us are available on Friday from noon
to 2pm. Therefore we will meet on Friday at noon each week as seen in
the above **Table 2**.

**Meeting Coordination**

*Team Meeting Reminder:*

In order to remind our team about meeting, we will text in our shared
group chat a few hours before the meeting begins. If someone is late, we
will remind them through text or a call to ensure everyone shows up.

*Team Meeting Changes:*

If there needs to be a change to a meeting, the team member must notify
the group and suggest a time they can meet instead. If that time works
for everybody, then the meeting will be changed to accommodate.

*Team Preferred Meeting Format:*

Meeting face to face will be the most effective method of communication
for our team, however virtual meeting is currently also acceptable. In
the future, it will become necessary to have in-person meetings as the
course becomes almost exclusively hands-on as it progresses.

*Team Procedures:*

Talk about assignments as a group in class, splitting the work as
necessary and then reconvening when the assignment is 90% completed to
discuss any questions and make sure everyone is on the same page before
submitting.

**Team Coordination**

*Team Assignment Submission:*

One member of the team will be in charge of submitting the assignment
and must verify with all team members before submitting.

*Team Knowledge/Skills:*

Each team member will be responsible for a certain part of each
assignment. If he or she is unable to complete their part, they must ask
for assistance from another member of the team before the due date. This
will help catch all members up to speed with the development of the
project.

*Team Prefered Design Feedback:*

Each member will check the other team members' work and cross check it
with the feedback given to ensure that it has been acted upon. This will
ensure that none of the work produced is conflicting with each other.

**Team Accountability**

*Accountability Charter:*

Each team member will be responsible for an equal amount of the work in
order to maintain equal responsibility amongst one another. Regular team
check-ins will make sure that contributions will not be missed.

*Accountability Expectations:*

Each team member will be expected to complete their work in order to be
a successful team. We all want to create the best design in the class
and that will only be accomplished through unified group work.

*Recognizing Underperforming Team members:*

If they are asking a lot of questions or need a more than usual amount
of help to perform a specific task.

*Supporting Team Members:*

We can help each other improve partly during class if it is a brief
problem or during our weekly meetings.

**Conflict and Resolution**

Controversy can be normal, but we all want to learn and should always be
kind and respectful to one another. I don't believe that this will be an
issue in our group, but if it does become a problem, we will host a team
meeting to discuss with all the team members to come up with a
compromise or resolution for the conflict.
