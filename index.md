# Introduction

Mobile weather stations are important for giving accurate weather information to local populations. These stations can also be used to monitor weather conditions during response operations. As well as personal or specific business needs where control, monitoring, and adaptation under select conditions are required. People need the ability to sense and respond to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and other modalities using I2C or SPI for a mobile weather station that connects over Wi-Fi. Throughout this report, the team will discuss different topics related to the completion of a successful prototype.

# Table of Contents

## [Team Organization](team_organization.md)

### Overview
Our Team Organization briefly covers our Team Charter and Mission Statement. It describes our main goals for this porject as well as what we hope to learn and accomplish. For more information on the teamâ€™s establishment please see [Appendix A](Appendix_A.md).

## [User Needs & Benchmarking](user_needs.md)

### Overview
Our User Needs and Benchmarking introduces how through VOC (Voice of Customer) Benchmarking, we were able to identify common issues addressed with products similar to our design restraints. By observing both positive and negative comments, we could identify what worked, and what was a recurring issue. We later grouped these into serperate categories of type and importance. Inside shows our process step by step, and how we came to identify these needs.

## [Product Requirements](product_requirements.md)

### Overview
In the Product Requirements section, we took what needs we found from the previous assignment and transformed them into requirements. This allows us to put guidelines on the project that weren't set by the instructor. 

## [Design Ideation](design_ideation.md)

### Overview
The Design Ideation goes over the process of generating ideas for ideas of the final design. In this section you can see the process of grouping, ranking, and coming up with a rough sketch of what our design should be. We generated three possible designs that could be used for the final product.  

## [Selected Design](selected_design.md)

### Overview
Selected Design briefly goes over how we came to decide what our final design should be, and why it was chosen. It goes more into depth on how our final design will function.

## [Block Diagram](block_diagram.md)

### Overview
Our Block Diagram goes over how our microcontroller will recieve and transmit data to all the other components. It also shows how each of the components will be powered and by what. 

## [Component Selection](component_selection.md)

### Overview
Component Selection describes each component selected and a brief paragraph as to why they were chosen. For more information on Component Selection, please see [Appendix B](Appendix_B.md)

## [Microcontroller Selection](microcontroller_selection.md)

### Overview
In Microcontroller Selection, it has reasoning on why we chose this microcontroller as well as images of the Surface Mount and  Through-Hole versions. It also links to the products page and its datasheet. For more information on Microcontroller Selection, please see [Appendix C](Appendix_C.md)

## [Hardware Proposal](hardware_proposal.md)

## [Software Proposal](software_proposal.md)
