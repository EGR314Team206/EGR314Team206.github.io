## Introduction

Mobile weather stations are important for giving accurate weather information to local populations. These stations can also be used to monitor weather conditions during response operations. As well as personal or specific business needs where control, monitoring, and adaptation under select conditions are required. People need the ability to sense and respond to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and other modalities using I2C or SPI for a mobile weather station that connects over Wi-Fi. Throughout this report, the team will discuss different topics related to the completion of a successful prototype.
