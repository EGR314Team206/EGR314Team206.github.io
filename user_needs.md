## User Needs Benchmarking
### VOC Introduction:
To determine common user needs for devices using sensors for various weather conditions, material of the product, objects with motor control, etc. The team started with searching for  different products that were similar to the requirements given for the project. Keywords used commonly pertained to weather as well as connectivity to find alike products. From there a specific product would be chosen (normally one with many reviews), and  three positive and three negative reviews were taken from it to spot the needs associated with it. Five products were chosen in total for this, and from that, 100 user needs were observed. Listed below are the five products, keywords used to find them, the link for the search results and the product, price, vendor, description, reviews, and a picture of the product chosen.

|“Having accurate readings of the immediate winds is crucial to adjusting the windage corrections in my hunting scopes or my target sights. Compact and easy to use, it makes the difference between a miss and a well-aimed shot.”|1. The product needs to have accurate readings (explicit) <br> 2. The product is compact and easy to use (explicit). <br> 3. device is good for hunting (latent). |
|“It is the easiest way to test the airflow of my central A/C. I recorded the flow with a new filter to establish a benchmark. Now I can monitor the condition of my filter and if the coils freeze over I will be able to see a decrease in air flow. This meter measures the speed and temperature of the air flow to each room. Easy to read. Highly recommend it as a must have for a homeowner.”|1. The device is good at testing airflow (explicit). <br> 2. Is able to measure the decrease in air flow (explicit). <br> 3.

|“This little gizmo works well and is more sensitive than I expected. While I was testing one without, a small rock flew from the filter and broke all but one of the fan blades. Only odd setting is the minimum airflow in my opinion. You need air to be moving through already to get an actual reading, which in some circumstances may be difficult if you can't see the screen while testing. Personally I don't need this function, but it is still a nice feature.. Batteries included, 2 AAA.|1. Very sensitive reading (explicit) <br> 2. Needs to be more durable (latent) <br> 3.

|“The unit was attractive and simple to use. Unfortunately, its readings had little relation to reality! I received the unit on a 60 degree fahrenheit day, with a strong weather front of 24 mph winds moving through my area. the HOLDPEAK 866B Digital Anemometer insisted it was 72 degrees and through repeated wind measurements gave me an average wind speed of 8 mph with max wind speed of 11.5 mph. I returned the device at a cost of $4.20, despite being a Prime member, because of the lithium batteries that require special hazmat handling.”|The readings need to be accurate (explicit) Requires lithium batteries (explicit)|
|“Neither one agrees with the other in terms of temp and wind speeds. Off by a country mile. The weather apps are showing a temp of 76 and winds at about 18-20 mph. Save your money, these both are truly worthless.”|Readings need to be accurate (latent) Temperature and wind speed need to be correct (explicit)|
|“ Next time we went to use it...all buttons would work...but it wouldn't read the wind. Took it home and pulled the batteries, let it sit a while, got a reading and then...nothing. Changed batteries, got a reading and then...nothing. Fussed with it again a couple days later and got a reading...turned it off and then back on...and...nothing. Just seems to work occasionally when it wants to but not when I need it to. What's the point? I can't trust it to be there when I need it. It was never knocked around, dropped, gotten damp...etc.”|Needs to read correctly every use (explicit) All buttons should function correctly (explicit) Shouldn’t need much maintenance (latent)|

|“. Rain gage that measures not only the amount of rain but hourly rain fall as well as 24 hour rain fall, weekly, monthly and rain event totals. The unit has a wind vain and anemometer for wind direction and speed, of course. It also has temperature with heat index and wind chill. We have a pool so I love that the unit measures UV index and Solar Radiation. Assembly: Not too difficult. Everything goes together pretty easy if you have a basic knowledge of putting things together. As for the unit itself the wind gauge does not look to read over 99.9 mph.”|1. The product is easy to assemble (explicit). <br> 2. It measures all aspects of weather, even less conventional ones, including UV index and radiation. (latent) <br> 3. The product should work for extreme weather conditions (latent).|
|“The color display is easy on the eyes although its much smaller then the one we had before. Reading the settings from an angle does seem a bit off but that's okay for us. Setting it up to Wifi takes a bit of doing and if you're not computer literate then it could be complicated. Getting the batteries in the unit that goes outside was a bit different, It doesn't clearly show you in the instructions and you'd need to be careful not to brake something. Took about 5 minutes to mount. I would recommend this model…”|1. Nice color display for readings (latent) <br> 2. Easy to set-up via Wi-fi (latent) <br> 3. Easy to install & replace power (explicit)|
|“1. Functional Design. The Ambient Weather station (AW) is the clear winner and way, way ahead of Acurite (AR). For starters, the internet connectivity is built-in and utilizes wireless. That is a horribly outdated and expensive design. Setup with the AW station was a breeze...I was assembled, mounted, and up and running on Wunderground within 20 minutes, and most of that was with the physical assembly. <br> 2. Accuracy. Once again, AW is the clear winner. All the readings on the AW were spot on right out of the box. Temp, rainfall, etc were good with no calibration necessary - though all readings can be calibrated if needed, that functional adjustment is built into the console. <br> 3. Durability. This is the one area I cannot yet commend the AW on, only time will tell. It appears to be a better-built unit so I am optimistic and will update this review as necessary.”| Functional design (explicit) <br> 2. Accurate readings (explicit) <br> 3.

The process just kept moving in an endless circle of "reconnect" warnings. <br> The console screen display sucks.

It's not in the huge manual. <br> The app is completely useless - I live relatively rurally. So it would not register my address.

It's been stuck at 10% Humidity and I did the reset after removing the batteries and taping up the solar sensor and that didn't work.. I live in a northern climate environment and they are saying "Heat" caused the failure....

That being said, it's really great to have a device that will text and email if there is a problem and I have tested the product by taking it out and waiting for my alert and sure enough it worked perfectly.

The Temp Stick not only keeps me apprised of the freezer temperature, but recently alerted me to a temperature spike, which was the result of a capacitor that failed, allowing me to take quick action to save everything in the freezer until I could procure the right capacitor and make the repair a few days later. <br> Setup and management is easy and the signal is strong -- even through the walls of a stainless steel commercial freezer.”|1.

The attic is directly above my office where the WiFi router is, so I'm hoping it will have a good connection. I'll update this review after I get some readings from this 2nd Temp Stick. <br> Update (01/02/2023): My new Temp Stick has been running for several days and it works great!

### Organizing Need Statements
### Process:
The team used jamboards to collect all thoughts and ideas to make user needs statements. The jamboard helped organize the needs into different categories to help understand what the user wants. This process took all four team members and was done over several hours. This allowed the team to fully grasp who the users were, what they needed, and what the team was to design. Overall, the jamboard process was a useful tool for the user needs assignment.

### Assessment of User Needs:
The process of forming the user needs statements started with the benchmarking assignment which helped the team understand what consumers expected out of their product and what they thought the product needed improvement on. The team took the positive and negative comments and turned them into user needs. Once the user needs were made, they were separated into groups based on the description. The groups became accuracy, durability, usability/user interaction, and convenience/safety. Safety included all those that revolved around how the product would mitigate harm to the user. Accuracy referred to how the user would interact with the product. Quality dealt with using durable materials to prevent the need to replace parts. The instructions category was for documentation on the item to avoid facilitator or user error. These 5 categories seemed to encapsulate most aspects of the user needs based on the benchmarking process. 
### Weighting of User Needs:
After that was the ranking process, this was a discussion on what was deemed the most important and least important to the project design. Durability, and user engagement deserved three stars, accuracy deserved two stars, and convenience/safely deserved one star. Durability and user engagement/experience were three stars because those were highlighted the most in the benchmarking. The accuracy deserved two stars is not as essential as the above groups. The convenience/safety were 1 star because it is not as important as the other categories since it is not a hazardous product and most customers purchasing this product expect some setup. Overall, the user needs process was very useful in helping the understanding of what the customers wanted.
