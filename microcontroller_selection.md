# Microcontroller Selection

## Selected Microcontroller
The micocontroller we decided to go with was the PIC18F27Q10, as not only does it have many similarites to the PIC18F47Q10, it also is the cheapest option at $1.48, with the least amount of pins to solder. It has 2 SPI and 2 I2C modules as well as compatability to MCC Melody. It also has the RX and TX pins required to communicate with the ESP32. Its supply voltage range is 1.8-5.5Vand can withstand up to 300mA, minimizing the chances of damaging it.
